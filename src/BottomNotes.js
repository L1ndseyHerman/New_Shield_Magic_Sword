                Done with Version 3.3, which involves unit testing using Jest. I did a bit of 
                googling, and it seems Jest is the most popular React JS testing framework. I mostly 
                followed <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started">This Guide</a> to 
                get started, minus 
                installing Jest since &quot;create react app&quot; already installed it.

                If you are a software developer who wants to look at 
                previous versions, you can go to
                my <a href="https://github.com/L1ndseyHerman/New_Shield_Magic_Sword/">
                GitHub</a>, change the branch from &quot;master&quot; to the version 
                you are looking for, then pull the code and run it in VS Code.

                I'd also like to shout out Tech With Tim's series of twelve
                React For Beginners videos on YouTube, the first of which
                is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6DRDIedVE&t=1s">Here</a>,  
                for being a great ReactJS learning resource.
